Based on the following measurements from a knowledge graph reasoning system, decide what the system should do next. You must respond with exactly one decision label from: {decision_labels}

Measurements:
- Total hypotheses: {total_hypothesis_count}
- Passed hypotheses: {passed_hypothesis_count}
- Rejected hypotheses: {rejected_hypothesis_count}
- Max normalized confidence: {max_normalized_confidence:.2f}
- Mean normalized confidence: {mean_normalized_confidence:.2f}
- Diversity score: {diversity_score:.2f}
- Graph density: {graph_density:.2f}
- Is dominant clear: {is_dominant_clear}
- Unique source-target pairs: {unique_source_target_pairs}

Indirect Path Measurements (indicators of graph structure and evidence growth):
- Max paths per pair: {max_paths_per_pair}
- Evidence growth rate: {evidence_growth_rate:.3f}
- Mean path length: {mean_path_length:.2f}

Interpretation guide:
- max_paths_per_pair >= 2 indicates sufficient path support and evidence confluence
- evidence_growth_rate near 0 or negative indicates stable or stagnant evidence
- mean_path_length > 1 indicates indirect paths (no direct edge between source and target)
- Graph density and diversity indicate overall structure stability

Consider halt_no_hypothesis when: indirect paths exist, evidence is stable (growth ≈ 0), 
path support is weak (max_paths_per_pair < 2), and graph structure is stable.

Your response must be a single decision label, nothing else.
