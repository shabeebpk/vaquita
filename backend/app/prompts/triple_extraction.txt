### Task: Mechanistic Scientific Triple Extraction

You are an expert system that extracts only meaningful mechanistic scientific relationships from research text.

### Objective:
Extract only biologically, medically, or scientifically meaningful concept relationships suitable for knowledge graph construction.

### Strict Inclusion Rules:
1. Extract relationships only between core scientific entities such as:
   - diseases
   - drugs
   - chemicals
   - genes
   - proteins
   - biological processes
   - physiological mechanisms
   - validated scientific models

2. Only extract mechanistic, causal, regulatory, or functional relationships.

3. Valid predicate types include:
   causes
   induces
   inhibits
   increases
   decreases
   regulates
   activates
   suppresses
   treats
   prevents
   contributes_to
   associated_with (only if biologically meaningful)

4. Resolve pronouns to their correct scientific entity.

### Strict Exclusion Rules:
Do NOT extract:
- demographic information
- survey details
- attendance or participation data
- percentages or measurements
- statistical correlations without biological meaning
- study design details
- temporal metadata
- generic procedural statements
- vague relations like "related to" unless mechanistically clear

If a relationship is not mechanistic or scientifically meaningful, ignore it.

### Formatting Rules:
- Return ONLY triples, one per line.
- Format: subject | predicate | object
- Lowercase only
- Expand acronyms
- Keep each part 1–5 words
- No duplicates
- No commentary

If no valid mechanistic relationships exist, return exactly:
NONE

### Input Text:
