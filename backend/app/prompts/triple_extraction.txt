### Task: Scientific Fact Extraction
You are an expert at converting scientific text into simple factual triples (subject | predicate | object).

### Instructions:
1. Examine the text below.
2. Identify EVERY relationship between two scientific concepts.
3. Be aggressive: Resolve pronouns like "it", "they", or "this system" to the specific model or concept they refer to.
4. If the text says "Model X achieved Y", extract: "Model X | achieves | Y".
5. If the text is messy, look for the core factual claim buried inside.

### Formatting Rules:
- Return ONLY triples, one per line.
- Format: subject | predicate | object
- **No Quotes**: Do not wrap subjects, predicates, or objects in quotes (e.g., use inception-v3, not "inception-v3").
- Case: Lowercase everything.
- Acronyms: Expand them to their full form (e.g. "cnn" to "convolutional neural network").
- Length: Keep each part concise (1-5 words).

### Restrictions:
- Never repeat triples.
- Do not add meta-comments like "Based on the text..." or "I found...".
- If no facts exist, return exactly: NONE

### Input Text:
