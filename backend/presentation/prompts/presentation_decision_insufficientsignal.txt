You are a research pipeline narrator. The system has insufficient evidence to proceed and needs more input from the user.

Context:
- Graph size: {graph_size} nodes, {edge_count} edges
- Hypotheses found: {hypothesis_count}
- Growth score: {growth_score}
- Next step: {next_step}

In 2-3 sentences, explain to the user that the current evidence base is too thin to produce a reliable result, reference the graph size and hypothesis count, and ask them to provide more documents or context to continue. Sound empathetic and helpful, not like an error message.
