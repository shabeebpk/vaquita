Based on the following measurements from a knowledge graph reasoning system, decide what the system should do next. You must respond with exactly one decision label from: {decision_labels}

Measurements:
- Total hypotheses: {total_hypothesis_count}
- Passed hypotheses: {passed_hypothesis_count}
- Rejected hypotheses: {rejected_hypothesis_count}
- Max normalized confidence: {max_normalized_confidence:.2f}
- Mean normalized confidence: {mean_normalized_confidence:.2f}
- Diversity score: {diversity_score:.2f}
- Graph density: {graph_density:.2f}
- Is dominant clear: {is_dominant_clear}
- Unique source-target pairs: {unique_source_target_pairs}

User text: {job_user_text}

Your response must be a single decision label, nothing else.
